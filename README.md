# Buy Adarsh a Chai! ☕  
A decentralized tipping application built with Next.js and Ethereum smart contracts, allowing users to send "chai" (tips) to Adarsh with personalized messages. Powered by MetaMask for wallet integration, this app features a modern, glassmorphic UI with smooth animations and responsive design.

## ✨ Features

- **Send Tips:** Connect MetaMask to send 0.001 ETH with a name and message.
- **View Memos:** Display all on-chain messages (memos) with sender details.
- **Modern UI:** Glassmorphic cards, vibrant gradients, and subtle animations.
- **Responsive Design:** Scales beautifully on desktop and mobile.
- **Accessible:** High-contrast text, focus states, and reduced motion support.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Listens for new memos via smart contract events.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, CSS Modules
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum, Ethers.js, MetaMask
- **Styling:** Custom CSS with glassmorphism, Google Fonts (Inter)
- **Smart Contract:** Solidity (deployed at `0x608f745a736Da98650f9A35b086409794F6D628b`)
- **Environment:** [Replit](https://replit.com/@adarshkr1380/BuyMeACoffee-Solidity-DeFi-Tipping-app)

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js (included in Replit)
- MetaMask browser extension
- Ethereum testnet funds (e.g., Sepolia ETH)
- Replit account

## 🚀 Setup in Replit

### Clone the Project

1. **Fork or import** this project in Replit.
2. Alternatively, create a new Replit project and copy the necessary files.

### Install Dependencies

Ensure the `package.json` includes:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "latest",
    "react": "latest",
    "react-dom": "latest",

### File Structure

```bash
├── pages/
│   ├── _app.js              # Global CSS import
│   ├── index.js             # Main app component
├── styles/
│   ├── global.css           # Global styles and variables
│   ├── Home.module.css      # Component-scoped styles
├── utils/
│   ├── BuyMeACoffee.json    # Smart contract ABI
├── package.json
├── README.md
```

### Run the App

1. Click the **Run** button in Replit.
2. Open the preview in a new tab (Replit’s iframe may restrict MetaMask).

## 🖥️ Usage

### Connect Wallet

1. Install MetaMask and connect to a testnet (e.g., Sepolia).
2. Click "Connect your wallet" to link your account.

### Send a Chai

1. Enter your name (optional, defaults to "anon").
2. Add a message (optional, defaults to "Enjoy your chai!").
3. Click "Send 1 Chai for 0.001ETH" to send 0.001 ETH to the contract.
4. Confirm the transaction in MetaMask.

### View Memos

1. After connecting, view all memos (name, message, timestamp) below the form.
2. New memos appear in real-time via contract events.

### Test Responsiveness

1. Use Replit’s preview or browser dev tools to test mobile layouts.

## 🎨 Styling Highlights

- **Glassmorphism:** Semi-transparent cards with blur effects for forms and memos.
- **Animations:** Smooth fadeIn and slideUp transitions for components.
- **Typography:** Clean, scalable fonts using Inter (Google Fonts).
- **Colors:** Vibrant gradient background with blue-green accents.
- **Responsive:** Fluid typography and layouts for all screen sizes.
- **Accessible:** High contrast, focus states, and reduced motion support.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `pages/index.js`: Main component with wallet connection, form, and memo display.
- `pages/_app.js`: Imports `global.css` for global styles.
- `styles/global.css`: Defines :root variables and global resets.
- `styles/Home.module.css`: Scoped styles for components (form, memos, etc.).
- `utils/BuyMeACoffee.json`: Smart contract ABI.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### MetaMask Not Connecting

- Open the preview in a new tab (not Replit’s iframe).
- Ensure MetaMask is on the correct testnet with sufficient ETH.

### Styles Not Applying

- Verify `global.css` import in `_app.js` and `Home.module.css` in `index.js`.
- Clear Replit’s cache (`Ctrl+C`, then `npm run dev`).

### Contract Errors

- Confirm the contract address (`0x608f745a736Da98650f9A35b086409794F6D628b`) and ABI match the deployed contract.

### Console Errors

- Check Replit’s preview console (Right-click > Inspect > Console) and share errors.
